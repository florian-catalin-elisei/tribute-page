        Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 - 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist,
        widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time. Einstein is best known
        for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the
        development of the theory of quantum mechanics. His equation E = mcÂ², which arises from
        relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".
